- Share navigation in the root layout and give each named section its own leaf route, so direct links and metadata remain independent.
- Keep ticker and timeline query options in a browser-safe market module and validate the public price request with an allowlist, so controls cannot request arbitrary instruments.
- Use a shared date-and-share calculator on home and Markets; clear submitted results when inputs or company change so results never describe stale inputs.
- Compute date-and-share returns from allowlisted daily closing prices on demand, using source trading dates and disclosing the split-adjusted share basis so share quantities and historical prices stay consistent.
- Derive extended-hours prices only from source observations within Yahoo session boundaries and display their timestamps so older sessions are not misrepresented as live trades.
- Fetch company quotes together through an allowlisted public market function and refresh without synthesizing ticks; chart stock prices separately from calculated portfolio results so axes remain truthful.
- Transfer the request-scoped Query cache through router dehydration/hydration so live market prices match the server-rendered snapshot on first load.
- Render candlesticks only from source OHLC observations; quote-only endpoints have no fabricated candle and below-close shading uses the latest session's previous close.
- Use a responsive SVG price plot for baseline clipping and source OHLC candles so the chart is visible on first render and both views share the calendar cursor.
